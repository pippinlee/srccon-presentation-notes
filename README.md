### Highlights

SRCCON was a win because of its diverse group of people. They proved it's not impossible to have a diverse tech conference.

#### Government and data 
* Let's identify holes in open data
* Both sides need to be patient and willing to work out kinds
* Dismissal of government processes as they begin opening up more data is usually shaky
* Set standards lower for beginning, and work towards better standards of data in government in future
* PDFs aren't an option - PDFs need to be solved
* Lack of resources means to pick up stream any open data initiatives within government will take 2x longer than expected
* Government employees started to see for themselves benefits of well organized standarized open data (see SF city officials)

#### A journalism business - sustainability
<https://github.com/sinker/twomillion>

* Goal was to create a detailed set of financial to be sustainable after 2 years
* Had initial 2mm in capital
* Most groups that presented had a event component -- apparently events are how journalism organizations should be bringing in revenue
* The majority of groups opted to have virtual offices to cut down on costs
* Groups focused on high end or very community driven markets like high end fashion, video games, veterens
* Markets that already have very strong preexisting commercial ties were mainly used
* Time was too limited for any group to come up with anything remarkable, but sustainable and remarkable don't necessarily need to live together

#### Long form - reusibility of code

* code for many stories has a positive half life
* Allen Tam says snowfall took months, would now take a week
* Important to focus on making things resusable from intial build process
* Build the abstraction for the common problems


#### Security blanket
<https://etherpad.mozilla.org/srcsecurity>

* Tools: 
	* [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/)
	* [Onionshare](https://onionshare.org/)
	* [minilock](https://minilock.io/)
	* [GPG tools](https://gpgtools.org/)
	* [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/)
* Important to understand that the literacy of the public of security on the web is highly correlated to the betterment of the web
* Currently crypto documentation is written for crytographers and security researchers not the public -- huge issue in transparency and humane documentation

### Highlights

SRCCON was a win because of its diverse group of people. They proved it's not impossible to have a diverse tech conference.

#### Government and data
* Let's identify holes in open data
* Both sides need to be patient and willing to work out kinds
* Dismissal of government processes as they begin opening up more data is usually shaky
* Set standards lower for beginning, and work towards better standards of data in government in future
* PDFs aren't an option - PDFs need to be solved
* Lack of resources means to pick up stream any open data initiatives within government will take 2x longer than expected
* Government employees started to see for themselves benefits of well organized standardized open data (see SF city officials)

#### Diversity
[Charting diversity in different newsrooms](http://community.scratchmag.net/diversity-in-journalism/)

* Bias: being "aware" starts pointing out unequal opportunities

#### A journalism business - sustainability
<https://github.com/sinker/twomillion>

* Goal was to create a detailed set of financial to be sustainable after 2 years
* Had initial 2mm in capital
* Most groups that presented had a event component -- apparently events are how journalism organizations should be bringing in revenue
* The majority of groups opted to have virtual offices to cut down on costs
* Groups focused on high end or very community driven markets like high end fashion, video games, veterans
* Markets that already have very strong preexisting commercial ties were mainly used
* Time was too limited for any group to come up with anything remarkable, but sustainable and remarkable don't necessarily need to live together

#### Long form - reusability of code
[Write up by KK Rebecca Lai](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/07/29/on-scaling-and-efficiency-of-long-form-news-story-design-at-srccon-2014/)

* code for many stories has a positive half life
* Allen Tam says snowfall took months, would now take a week
* Important to focus on making things reusable from initial build process
* Build the abstraction for the common problems


#### Security blanket
<https://etherpad.mozilla.org/srcsecurity>

* Tools:
	* [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/)
	* [Onionshare](https://onionshare.org/)
	* [minilock](https://minilock.io/)
	* [GPG tools](https://gpgtools.org/)
	* [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/)
* Important to understand that the literacy of the public of security on the web is highly correlated to the betterment of the web
* Currently crypto documentation is written for cryptographers and security researchers not the public -- huge issue in transparency and humane documentation

	* [Predictive services program](http://psgeodata.fs.fed.us/download.html)
	* [NPR's Firecast - mapping wildfires](http://apps.npr.org/fire-forecast/)
* Goal: give multiple angles: micro/macro
* How can you tell the story visually locally VS globally
* People who don't live close need different context

#### How NOT to skew with statistics
<https://etherpad.mozilla.org/bOwBSAeLe5>

* Al Shaw put together some great [Raster Date](https://gist.github.com/ashaw/0862ec044c45b9aa3c76)
* Be transparent about data
* Normalize data: 50% drop out rate means very different things if school is only 4 students big
* When is it important to flatten data? [dichotomizing variables](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16565/what-is-the-effect-of-dichotomising-variables)
